Multi APK Tool is a tool to extract and repack multiple APK files, at once.

As a ROMs developer, I have encountered many times the need to edit a large amount of APK files.
I usually use APK easy tool or MT Manager, but they are can't to edit multiple APK files, at once.
beacuse this, I'm wrriting a CMD script that can to do it. 
This is not an elegant solution; It runs the same commands over and over 30 times.
But it is useful :)
I hope later to make it really effective...

**Update 16.01.2024**

I decided to concentrate my scripts in one project, [Cobalt Scripts](https://github.com/AshiVered/Cobalt-Scripts).
This script also moved there, and got a new name.
[Cobalt ApkTool](https://github.com/AshiVered/Cobalt-Scripts/tree/main/Cobalt-ApkTool).
