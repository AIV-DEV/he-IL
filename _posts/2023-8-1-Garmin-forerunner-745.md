##### The interesting part 😉
This blog isn't for sportmans... 🏃‍♂️🤦‍♂️. it's for geeks and technology enthusiasts 💪.
because this, I don't write reviews about sports accessories here; I share development and research experiences.

So, I googled about rooting\jailbreaking or other any hacks for this smartwatch. and... I didn't find any information 😡.
In some forums (for example 4PDA) I found information about editing the language files, low firmware, etc., but there was no information about modding and hacking.

But, you can to download apps from the ConnectIQ store to this device.

Okay, that good. This means that there is a developer mode that allows sideloading, obviously...

Indeed, I found [official documentation for developing apps and sideloading](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/your-first-app/) them.

Oh, that's interesting...

Updates soon, with God's help.
